## mediums:

## Todo


#### setting up environments :
* [Acrobot (what is its difficulty?)](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1/)
* [cartpole (what is its difficulty?)](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)
* [mountain car (what is its difficulty?)](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0)
* [mountain car continuous (what is its difficulty?)](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/)
* [Breakout (what is its difficulty?)](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Breakout-v0/)
* [Monte Zumas revenge (notoriously difficult)](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MontezumaRevenge-v0/)

#### Implementing tricks:
* [experience replay](http://www.incompleteideas.net/lin-92.pdf)
* [target network](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf), [target network]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04133.pdf) (general RL, not necessarily DQN)
* gradient clipping [see](https://abhishm.github.io/DQN/) [specific, paper source? many papers in use it when searching on scholar but there doesnt seem to be a justifying paper]
* [batch sizes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04133.pdf) (general RL, not necessarily DQN)
* [step size](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04133.pdf) (general RL, not necessarily DQN)
* find more tricks [with source]


#### Algorithm/DQN-related
* check if we're using the semi-gradient version in the assignment
* hyperparameter parser/config
* result graphing

## Ask TA:
* what does a 10 look like for a blog? - could some example of a '9.5+' grade blog be posted blogs?
